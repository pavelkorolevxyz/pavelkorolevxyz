I'm an Android developer with 10+ years of experience. I've been working as a single developer, in small outsource studios and big products with thousands of them.

Personal impact on products I work on is the thing I like the most. So it's evolved to be my main field of interest: make my and teammates everyday work easier and more productive. I like automation, **CI/CD**, **Gradle**, I care about the build speed and scalability of apps I build. Architectural point of view is the thing that makes me stand out, though I still understand where it's possible to cut the corners and make the business move as fast as possible.

Right now I feel most comfortable working with **Kotlin**, **RxJava** (or **Coroutines**), **Dagger**, **OkHttp**, **Retrofit**, **Jetpack MVVM** (UDF).

More apart I always keep an eye on the latest Android development trends such as **Kotlin Multiplatform** or **Jetpack Compose**, trying out them on my pet projects and looking forward to use them in production.
